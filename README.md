# Dice-Game

Dice Game is an interactive web page which mimics the roll of two dice. It uses HTML and CSS in conjunction with JavaScript. In addition, the Document Object Model (DOM) is utilized to change object specific properties such as image and text.

## Getting Started

Simply refresh the page in order to roll the two dice corresponding to the two players. The winner of the dice roll will be shown at the top of the screen. There can be three outcomes: "Player 1 wins", "Player 2 wins", or "Draw". Once the results are shown, refresh the page in order to roll again.
